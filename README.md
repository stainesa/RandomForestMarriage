# RandomForestMarriage
Repository for paper on simulation of UK Home Office random forests for detecting sham marriage in migrants.

Briefly, the UK uses a random forest model to support marriage registrars in detecting 'sham' marriages. This is done using data collected at the time of application, which is typically 4 weeks before the proposed date for the ceremony. The stated purpose is to identify marriages which require further investigation. Such marriages can be postponed.
